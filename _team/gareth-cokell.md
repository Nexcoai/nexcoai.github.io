From the beginning of his career he has been passionate about optimising the development process and has previously held roles coaching developers in extreme programming (XP) and transitioning teams onto agile practices. Gareth led the rewrite of radiotimes.com, shepherding the site through re-launch, sale and subsequent expansion, resulting in the tripling of monthly unique users to 3.5m and the return of the Radio Times brand to the #1 position in the market.
